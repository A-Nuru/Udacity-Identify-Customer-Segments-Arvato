## Installation
The libraries needed to run the code are the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation
This is the third project of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.







## File Descriptions
There are a iPython notebook and a html file to showcase work related to this project. The html file was generated from iPython notebook.

## Results

* A good relatioship exists between the general and customers population data. 
* The customers clusters are not universal i.e., the customers are not uniformly distributed in the general population with the population clusters so customers resides in certain clusters. 
* The mail oreder company should target the clusters 2 and 16 where the customers data are over represented and neglect clusters 1,4, 10 where the customers clusters are under represented. 
* The over-represented customer clusters shows that it belongs to category of older(45-60) and average income earners male. 
* On the other hand, the customers clusters that are underrepresented belong to the category of younger and average earners females.
